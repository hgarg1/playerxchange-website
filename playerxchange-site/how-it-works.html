      <div class="accordion" data-accordion data-observe data-animate="scale-in">
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>Is this legal for college athletes?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Yes. PlayerXChange is designed around NCAA/NAIA guidance and school-level NIL policies, complete with disclosure tools for compliance teams. We work directly with compliance offices to ensure all activities align with institutional policies and state regulations.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>Do I need crypto to participate?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            No. You can fund your wallet in USD using credit cards, debit cards, or ACH transfers. Blockchain technology runs behind the scenes to provide transparency and verifiable ownership, but you never need to interact with cryptocurrency directly. Export to self-custody wallets is optional for advanced users.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>What exactly am I buying when I purchase shares?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            You're purchasing limited utility shares tied to an athlete's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL). This is not equity in the athlete as a person—it's a digital collectible that grants you access to perks, exclusive content, and trading rights. Each share represents a percentage of the total supply for that athlete's drop.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>How do athlete royalties work?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Royalties are embedded in each smart contract and automatically routed to the athlete on every secondary sale. The royalty percentage is set at mint time and cannot be changed. Athletes receive these payments directly to their PlayerXChange account, with full transparency and tax reporting built in.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>Can I sell my shares anytime?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Generally yes, subject to marketplace hours, policy windows, and any temporary pauses for compliance or athlete safety. Athletes can request trading pauses during sensitive periods (injuries, transfers, etc.), and the platform may pause trading during compliance reviews or system maintenance.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>What are the fees?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Primary mints include a platform fee (typically 5-10%) that covers compliance, infrastructure, and support. Secondary marketplace trades include a small transaction fee (2-3%) plus the automatic royalty to the athlete. All fees are transparent and displayed before you confirm any transaction.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>How do perks work?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Perks are tiered based on your ownership percentage or total share count. Common perks include exclusive content access, meet-and-greets, VIP seating, merchandise discounts, raffle entries, and AMA sessions. Each athlete sets their own perk structure, which is visible before you purchase. Perks unlock automatically when you reach the required tier.

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>What happens if an athlete transfers schools or goes pro?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Your shares remain valid and retain their utility. Athletes can continue offering perks and receiving royalties regardless of their school or professional status. The platform supports athletes through their entire career journey, from college to professional leagues.

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>How is my personal information protected?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            We use bank-level encryption, KYC/AML compliance partners, and strict data privacy controls. Your personal information is never shared with athletes or other users. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations. See our Privacy Policy for full details.

        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>Can athletes see who owns their shares?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Athletes can see aggregate statistics (total supply, ownership distribution, etc.) but not individual fan identities unless you choose to reveal yourself through messaging or perk redemption. This protects fan privacy while giving athletes insights into their community.

          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            We offer account recovery through email verification and two-factor authentication. If you've enabled self-custody export, you can recover your shares using your private keys. Contact support immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.

          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>How do drops work?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Drops are limited-time events where athletes release a fixed number of shares at a set price. You'll see countdown timers, supply limits, and pricing before the drop starts. Shares are sold on a first-come, first-served basis or through raffles, depending on the athlete's preference.

        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-button" type="button" aria-expanded="false" data-accordion-trigger>Can I gift shares to someone else?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Yes, you can transfer shares to other verified PlayerXChange users. The recipient must have a verified account and meet any applicable compliance requirements. Transfers are subject to the same royalty and fee structure as marketplace sales.

          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            PlayerXChange has built-in compliance monitoring and works with compliance offices to prevent violations. If an athlete is found to have violated rules, we may pause trading and work with the athlete and their school to resolve the issue. Your shares remain valid, but trading may be temporarily restricted.

            Athletes can apply through our athlete portal. We review applications based on eligibility, compliance readiness, and platform fit.

            You must be 18 or older to create an account and participate in trading. Athletes must meet their institution's eligibility requirements and be at least 18 years old. We verify age as part of our KYC process.

            We accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), debit cards, and ACH bank transfers. Cryptocurrency payments are not required, but we may offer them as an optional payment method in the future.

          <div class="accordion-panel" data-accordion-panel>
            Most verifications complete within 24-48 hours. You'll need to provide a government-issued ID and may be asked for additional documentation. Once verified, you can immediately start minting, trading, and accessing perks.
